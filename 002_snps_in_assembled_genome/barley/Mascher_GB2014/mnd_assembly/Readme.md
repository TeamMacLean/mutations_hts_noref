### Barley _mnd_ mutant exome seqeuncing

The _many-noded dwarf_ (_mnd_) exome data is described by [Mascher and Jost et al 2014](http://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2014-15-6-r78)

X-ray mutagenesis of barley cv. Saale, identified _mnd_. F2 population was developed by crossing _mnd_ to barley cv. Barke. DNA from 18 mutant and 30 wildtype plants from F2 population were randomly selected and bulk sequenced.
Paired-end 100 bp reads sequenced and data is available to [download from SRA] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJEB5319/)

#### Exome assembly

wildtype pool data is used to assemble the exome of barley

spades 3.6.0 is used for assembly

assembly inputs and assembly log are [available in following directory] (./spades_assembly_info)
