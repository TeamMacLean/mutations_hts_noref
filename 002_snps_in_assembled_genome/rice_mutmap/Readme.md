### Mutmap rice ems mutagenesis data

The data is described by [Abe et al 2012](http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v30/n2/abs/nbt.2095.html)

Sequencing data for the mutants studied in above report are [availabe from SRA] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=DRA000499)

Hitomebore reference sequence used in the Mutmap is available [from NCBI Bio project] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJDA67163)

Paired-end 75 bp reads were mapped to Oryza sativa cv. "Nipponbare" reference genome (IRGSP build 5).
The genomic regions covered with at least two reads were called as contigs.
SNPs but not indels have been reflected to the consensus contigs.

From [MutMap+ study] (http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0068529) it appears that hitomebore genome sequencing data is [submitted at SRA](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/DRA000927)

#### Hit5814 data

Hit5814-sd data is downloaded from accession number DRR001790.

Hitomebore reads downloaded from accession number
DRR004451

Variants were called for Hit5814 and wildtype using Hitomebore scaffolds.
