### Bulked RNA-seq data analysis using Maize ems data

RNA-seq data published from [Liu et al PlosOne 2012] (http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0036406)
is used for the analysis.

RNA-seq data generated using bulks of maize *glossy* mutant and wildtype phenotyped plants.

Mutation is recessive

RNA-seq data is quality is checked using fastqc

fastqc reports of raw data is located at ....

cutadapt was used to trim adapters and remove low quality reads

fastqc reports of the cutadapt resulting reads are available at .....


Quality filtered data is used to assemble transcriptome of maize samples




Trimmomatic is used to quality filter reads for adapter and poor base qualities.

fastqc reports of trimmomatic data is provided at ....
