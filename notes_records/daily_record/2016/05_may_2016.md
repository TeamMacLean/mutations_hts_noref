## May 2016

1. De-novo assembly of rice hitomebore short read data. More details are available [in the data folder](../../../002_snps_in_assembled_genome/rice_mutmap/denovo_assembly_hitomebore/)

2. Individual k-mer contigs were pooled and reduced redundency from different k-mer assemblies using cap3 and resulting combined contigs were used for scaffolding with soap-denovo

3. This multi k-mer based pooling strategy has produced an assembly with much redundancy, so needs to repeat the anlysis using only one kmer or an alternate assembly methods

4. Started new repo 'CHERIPIC' to implement the method as command line tool and as a gem with better defined objects.

5. Released Cheripic initial gem to the Rubygems

6. Started adding all the methods and analysis pipeline to cheripic repo
