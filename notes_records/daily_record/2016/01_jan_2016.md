## Januray 4th to 8th

1. Bulk segregant analysis using wheat RNA-seq data has been [previously done](http://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2229-12-14), using this data to test sdm based transcript arrangement to find/ narrow down GPC-B1 allele

2. Assembly transcriptome has been carried out and variant analysis is being done to proceed for transcriptome fragment arragement. More details about the analysis can be found in the [readme file](003_transcriptome_arrange/wheat_data/Readme.md)


## Januray 11th to 15th
