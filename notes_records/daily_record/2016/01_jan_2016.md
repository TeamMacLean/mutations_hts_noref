2. [Januray 11 - 15]  (#januray-11th-to-15th)

## Januray 4th to 8th

1. Bulk segregant analysis using wheat RNA-seq data has been [previously done](http://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2229-12-14), using this data to test sdm based transcript arrangement to find/ narrow down GPC-B1 allele

2. Assembly transcriptome has been carried out and variant analysis is being done to proceed for transcriptome fragment arragement. More details about the analysis can be found in the [readme file](003_transcriptome_arrange/wheat_data/Readme.md)

3. sorting of the rna-seq transcripts using vairant information picked 40 transcripts. Need to verify if the candidate genes is in the list. Addtionally alternative variant calling for tetrploid data using FreeBayes is being tested

## Januray 11th to 15th

1. SDM code updated to make original and experimental data comparisons, when provided. Filtering parameters to prioritized selected contigs and mutations such as using pileup information.

2. Code for RNA-seq based bulk analysis module is being written that includes both expression based and variant bases selection of candidate genes/mutations
