## August 1st to 5th

1. Completed documentation for Cheripic gem

2. Packaged Cheripic to be standalone using [travelling ruby guidelines](http://phusion.github.io/traveling-ruby/) for osx and linux-x86_64

3. Implementation testing of program using test data inputs



## August 8th to 26th

1. Prepartion of cheripic to be implemented as galaxy tool

2. Modified outputs of Cheripic to a single file instead of seperate directory for easy implementation as Galaxy tool

3. Using simulate bulk sequence and Allen et al mir159 bulks filtered hasty mutant bulk variants as markers for F2 simulation

4. Simulated pools of 30 plants for each bulk per simulation.

5. Simulated Illumina sequencing performed at 20X depth

6. 20 F2 bulks simulated and 10 random sequencing reads generated resulting in 200 bulk populations
