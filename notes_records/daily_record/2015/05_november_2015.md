## November 2nd to 6th

1. Variants identified from assembly around the causative mutation are plotted with assembly lengths as bins for sup1, sup2, soc1 and hasty.

2. Distribution of ratios around causative mutation using assembly lengths have not shown any clear pattern of primary peaks close to the causative mutation regardless of whether ratios are adjusted for lengths of the assembly or not.

3. In addition to the assembly, random 1000 iterations of arabidopsis genome fragmented with modelled log-normal distribution derived arabidopsis assemblies were generated to test above points independently. variant frequencies are taken from published studies.
