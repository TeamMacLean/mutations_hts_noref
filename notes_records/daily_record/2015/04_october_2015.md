### Table of Cotents
1. [October 5 - 9](#october-5th-to-9th)


## October 5th to 9th

1. SNP variants were called for published studies of arabidopsis to be used for homozygous to heterozygous ratio distribtuon around the causative muation

2. Details of the datasets are in the following folder [002_snps\_in\_assembled\_genome/contig\_snp\_distribution](../../../002_snps_in_assembled_genome/contig_snp_distribution/)

3. Parent filtered data is being used to model the variant ratio arrangement aroudn the causative mutation

4. Vairnt positions for [allen et al data] (../../../002_snps_in_assembled_genome/contig_snp_distribution/arabidopsis/allen_etal/hsty/) were divided in to chunks of 10kb, 50kb, 100kb, 500kb, 1Mb, 5Mb and 10Mb.

5. polyfitted the homozygous, heterozygous and the ratio between two variants for these genome chunk distributions


## October 12th to 16th

1. Completed polyfit of 4 arabidopsis datasets and produced graphs for each bin size

2. Working towards to define the peak and fit parameters to peak distribution
